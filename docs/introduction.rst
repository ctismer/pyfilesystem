Introduction
============

PyFilesystem is a Python module that provides a common interface to disparate filesystems -- which allows you to write code that works with files and directories regardless of their source and location.

Think of PyFilesystem (FS) objects as the next logical step to Python's _file_ objects. Just as file-like objects abstract a single file, FS objects abstract the whole filesystem by providing a common interface to operations such as reading directories, getting file information, opening/copying/deleting files etc.

For example, if you had written a method that reads a few files from the local filesystem, it would be a trivial change if you later decided to read those files from a zip file or even over the Internet.
