Utility Modules

PyFilesystem also contains some miscellaneous utility modules to make writing
new FS implementations easier.


fs.path
-------
Contains many utility functions for manipulating filesystem paths. See :mod:`fs.path`.

fs.errors
---------
Contains all the standard error classes used by PyFilesystem, along with some useful error-handling decorators. See :mod:`fs.errors`.

fs.filelike
-----------
Takes care of a lot of the groundwork for implementing and manipulating objects that support Python's standard "file-like" interface. See :mod:`fs.filelike`.

fs.remote
