fs.filelike
===========

This module takes care of the groundwork for implementing and manipulating
objects that provide a rich file-like interface, including reading, writing,
seeking and iteration.

The main class is FileLikeBase, which implements the entire file-like interface
on top of primitive _read(), _write(), _seek(), _tell() and _truncate() methods.
Subclasses may implement any or all of these methods to obtain the related
higher-level file behaviors.

Other useful classes include:

    * StringIO:   a version of the builtin StringIO class, patched to more
                  closely preserve the semantics of a standard file.

    * FileWrapper:  a generic base class for wrappers around a filelike object
                    (think e.g. compression or decryption).

    * SpooledTemporaryFile:  a version of the builtin SpooledTemporaryFile
                             class, patched to more closely preserve the
                             semantics of a standard file.

    * LimitBytesFile:  a filelike wrapper that limits the total bytes read
                       from a file; useful for turning a socket into a file
                       without reading past end-of-data.

    """Base class for implementing file-like objects.

    This class takes a lot of the legwork out of writing file-like objects
    with a rich interface.  It implements the higher-level file-like methods
    on top of five primitive methods: _read, _write, _seek, _tell and
    _truncate. See their docstrings for precise details on how these methods
    behave.

    Subclasses then need only implement some subset of these methods for
    rich file-like interface compatibility.  They may of course override
    other methods as desired.

    The class is missing the following attributes and methods, which don't
    really make sense for anything but real files:

        * fileno()
        * isatty()
        * encoding
        * mode
        * name
        * newlines

    Unlike standard file objects, all read methods share the same buffer
    and so can be freely mixed (e.g. read(), readline(), next(), ...).

    This class understands and will accept the following mode strings,
    with any additional characters being ignored:

        * r    - open the file for reading only.
        * r+   - open the file for reading and writing.
        * r-   - open the file for streamed reading; do not allow seek/tell.
        * w    - open the file for writing only; create the file if
                 it doesn't exist; truncate it to zero length.
        * w+   - open the file for reading and writing; create the file
                 if it doesn't exist; truncate it to zero length.
        * w-   - open the file for streamed writing; do not allow seek/tell.
        * a    - open the file for writing only; create the file if it
                 doesn't exist; place pointer at end of file.
        * a+   - open the file for reading and writing; create the file
                 if it doesn't exist; place pointer at end of file.

    These are mostly standard except for the "-" indicator, which has
    been added for efficiency purposes in cases where seeking can be
    expensive to simulate (e.g. compressed files).  Note that any file
    opened for both reading and writing must also support seeking.
